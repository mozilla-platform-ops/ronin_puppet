- Documentation of the legacy `win32_taskscheduler` provider and the `taskscheduler_api2`, ensuring users will not need to refer to Puppet core documentation ([MODULES-6417](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-6417))
- New helper for `taskscheduler_api2` allowing it to manage scheduled tasks of any compatibility level ([MODULES-6844](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-6844), [MODULES-6845](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-6845))

- Metadata to support only Puppet version `4.9.0` and above, as earlier versions do not support translation, which this module uses (MAINT)
- Error message for a user-specified invalid value for the `day_of_week`, ensuring that the resulting error communicates the actual problem to the user ([MODULES-6398](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-6398))
- Conflation of two types of monthly triggers, separating them into distinct triggers to prevent erroneous error messages ([MODULES-6268](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-6268))
- Setting of triggers in timezones other than UTC, ensuring that the specified times in triggers will be applied as local-time on the node ([MODULES-7026](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-7026))
