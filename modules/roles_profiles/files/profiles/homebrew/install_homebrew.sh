#
#   Inspiration for portions of this script taken from homebrew-3.3.sh.
#   Original credit to Tony Williams (Honestpuck)
#   https://github.com/Honestpuck/homebrew.sh/blob/master/homebrew-3.3.sh
#
#   This script silently installs Homebrew as the most common local user.
#   This script can be set to "every 15 minutes" or "daily" to ensure Homebrew remains
#   installed.
#
#   NOTE: This script is designed to added brew to the current user's PATH, but if a user has
#   pre-existing CLI sessions open, the brew command may not be recognized. The user will need
#   to relaunch their sessions (ex - zsh -l) or start a new session so that brew is seen in
#   their PATH.
#
#   For the latest on brew Apple Silicon compatibility,
#   see: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857

# CHANGELOG
################################################################################################
#
#   1.2.0
#       - Added check for Apple Silicon homebrew binary location
#
#   1.3.0
#       - Code refactor
#           - Moved Rosetta2 check to a function
#           - Added additional comments for clarification
#           - Changed how permissions and ownership are set for brew and dependencies
#           - Change how brew doctor is interpreted and let admin know to check logs
#             for more info. Apple Silicon has a warning showing that brew is not
#             installed at /usr/local and might have unexpected behavior some app
#             installs that have not been updated for Apple Silicon.
#       - Added separate permissions and ownership logic for brew installed on Apple
#         Silicon
#       - Added local logging to /Library/Logs/homebrew_install.log
#       - Added check for Xcode CLI tools and will install them if not present
#       - Added support for homebrew install as a standard user.
#
#   1.3.1
#       - Added logic to determine most common user if a logged-in user is not found.
#       - Added additional logic to validate OS versions for Xcode CLI tools
#         compatibility
#
#   1.4.0
#       - Refactored brew install process so that the curl command is only downloading
#         the latest brew tarball file to the correct location
#       - Added function that creates the brew environment
#       - General code refactor
#       - Added additional logging output
#
#   1.4.1
#       - Minor refactor and bug squashing
#
#   1.4.2
#       - Added -a flag to tee binary to ensure that the local log file is appended to
#         and not overwritten. (credit - Glen Arrowsmith)
#       - Added additional logging
#       - updated latest tested OS versions
#
#   1.4.3
#       - Updated logging to note where brew is not able to be called from a CLI
# session that is already in progress. Workaround was to close all CLI
#         sessions and then launch a new session.
#       - Added logic to update the user's PATH in either .zshrc or .bashrc with path
#         to the brew binary.
#
#   1.4.4
#       - Grammar fixes and updates :P
#
#   1.5.0
#       - Moved logic for xcode install check up in the script to account for scenarios
#         on Apple Silicon where cli tools require reinstalation when upgrading from
#         one macOS version to the next.
#
#   1.5.1
#       - Updated logic when adding and validating that brew is in the current user's PATH.
#
#   1.5.2
#       - Updated Xcode CLI tools install logic to also check for any avaialble updates via
#         software update, and install those if the latest available version is newer that the
#         installed version.
