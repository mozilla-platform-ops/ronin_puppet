# (/etc/start-worker.yml) we set numberOfTasksToRun to 1 so that the worker
# will exit after running a single task. This script is then responsible for
# rebooting the machine.

# If this file exists when the worker starts up, and its content is equal
# to numberOfTasksToRun, the worker won't exit and machine won't reboot.
