#
# Example configuration
#
# Typical this check is placed on a client and run via nrpe
# so add this to nrpe.cfg:
#  command[check_puppet_agent]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_puppet -w 3600 -c 7200
# This should warn when the agent hasnt run for an hour and go critical after two hours
#  if you have dont_blame_nrpe=1 set you can choose to
#  command[check_puppet_agent]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_puppet -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$
#
# define service {
#  use generic-service
#  service_description Puppet agent
#  check_command check_nrpe!check_puppet_agent
# or
#  check_command check_nrpe!check_puppet_agent!3600!7200 
#}

# CHANGELOG:
# 20120126	A.Swen	    created.
# 20120214  trey85stang Modified, added getopts, usage, defaults

# 20120509  hwine       tweaks for older puppet versions and extra data,
#                       and puppets only run on boot
